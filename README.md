BMI Calculator is a beginner-friendly Flutter app that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their weight and height. It was created as a personal learning project when I began exploring Flutter development. 
- Enter weight (kg) and height (cm) -> BMI calculation + Status interpretation (e.g., Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese)
- Simple UI, responsive, mobile friendly layout.
